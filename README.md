# dockerfiles

A collection of Dockerfiles for pwn, organized by libc version. 

## How To Use

Run the `build.sh` command in a folder to build the image. 

Then run `run.sh` from anywhere to mount the current directory under `/pwn` of the docker image. You can also just copy the command (it's only one line) from `run.sh` to customize as you see fit.
